## Lab structure

### Method
* Labs are divided into steps
* Participants begin with an empty file
* Instructor displays the complete, rendered result in browser
* Participants should interpret and try to replicate
* Each lab is divided into a subfolder named labX containing an *index.html* and a *solution.html*

```
lab1/
    index.html
    solution.html
lab2/
    index.html
    solution.html
lab3/
    index.html
    solution.html
```
