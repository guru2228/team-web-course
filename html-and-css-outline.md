# HTML and CSS

## HTML

* Structure
    * Basic building blocks (doctype, body etc.)
* Elements
    * The most basic elements
        * Headlines
        * Paragraphs

        * (span)
    * More advanced elements
        * Lists

## CSS

* Basic styling
    * Pseudo classes
* Basic layout
* Box model
* Positioning
* The cascade (inheritance, specificity)
    * multiple IDs, classes etc.
* Styling of forms
* Media queries

* Firebug / Inspector

* CSS3 fallbacks, how to degrade well in older browsers

* Agent (browser), reader and author stylesheets (?)


## Lab structure

### Method
* Labs are divided into steps
* Participants begin with an empty file
* Instructor displays the complete, rendered result in browser
* Participants should interpret and try to replicate
* Each lab is divided into a subfolder named labX containing an ***index.html*** and a ***solution.html***

```
lab1/
    index.html
    solution.html
lab2/
    index.html
    solution.html
lab3/
    index.html
    solution.html
```
