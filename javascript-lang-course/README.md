## Mocha Labs

In the lab directory you will find a number of Javascript files along with some
tests. The object of this lab is to get all the tests to pass.

* Open tests.html in a browser.
* Open up the Javascript files in an editor.
* Edit the source files, *not the tests*, until all the tests pass.
